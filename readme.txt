== Description ==
Reply to any post, forum topic and forum reply **simply by sending e-mail reply**.

Plugin sends a notification message with customized Reply-to address, which enables to pass the reply to the correct place and post it to the Wordpress. 
It strips away the quoted part of the message, so only the reply gets posted to the forum.
